# Pothole Detection System

This repository contains the implementation of a Pothole Detection System, where multiple machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms were applied and compared to determine the best-performing model. The primary goal of this system is to accurately detect potholes using various approaches and evaluate their performance.

## Project Overview
Potholes on roads are a significant safety concern and can cause severe damage to vehicles. Detecting potholes accurately using an automated system can help mitigate these issues. This project explores and compares various ML and DL algorithms to identify the optimal solution for pothole detection.

### Key Highlights
- **Deep Learning Approach**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were implemented, and they outperformed all other models in terms of accuracy.
- **Pre-trained Model**: The VGG16 architecture was fine-tuned but suffered from overfitting on the dataset.
- **Machine Learning Approach**: Random Forest was the best-performing ML model.
- **Overall Performance**: While Random Forest achieved high accuracy among ML models, CNN showed superior performance overall.

## Conclusion
The Pothole Detection System demonstrates that deep learning models, particularly CNN, excel in tasks requiring feature extraction from image data. While Random Forest proved to be the best ML model, it could not surpass the accuracy of CNN. Future work can focus on:
- Addressing the overfitting issue in VGG16 by using techniques like data augmentation or regularization.
- Exploring other pre-trained models like ResNet or EfficientNet.
- Optimizing the hyperparameters of the CNN model for further improvement.
